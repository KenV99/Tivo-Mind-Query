Main use is to obtain Series and Program IDs when not obtained via MetaGenerator 3 due to naming conflicts between TiVo and other servers

Thanks to dlfl and wmcbrine for rpcSearch102.py

Requires:

futures 3.03

wx Python or wxPython-Phoenix


Launch by running mind_query.py from command line at least first time.
If wxPython or futures is not installed user will be prompted for download/install from command line.
